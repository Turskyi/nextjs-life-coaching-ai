            Additionally, you can delete your data anytime through the website

          <H2>Use of Information</H2>
          <p>
            - <strong>Email and User ID</strong>: These are used to authenticate
            and identify you within the website.
            <br />- <strong>Goals</strong>: Your personal goals, including their

          <H2>Data Retention and Deletion</H2>
          <p>
            - <strong>Personal Data</strong>: The personal data we collect
            (email, user ID, and goals) is stored securely by our third-party
            services. Your email is stored on Clerk&apos;s servers, while your
            user ID and goals are stored on MongoDB&apos;s servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            - <strong>Goal Management</strong>: You can delete any of your goals
            at any time within the website. Once deleted, they are permanently
            removed from our database.
          </p>

            all associated data by following the instructions on our{' '}
            <a href="/instruction">Account Deletion Instructions</a> page. To

            the app and navigate to the account button at the top of the{' '}
            <a href="/goals">Goals</a> page. From there, select &quot;Manage
            account&quot; to access account management options provided by

            your account details, but not your goals. To delete your account
            along with your goals, follow the instructions on our account
            deletion page. After deleting your account, all associated data,
            including your email, user ID, and goals, will be permanently
